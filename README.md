# ML-CIFAR100-classification
datasets: 
CIFAR-100, https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 100 classes containing 600 images each, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).

The main objective of this report is to classify the CIFAR-100 dataset using five different classification
algorithms and analyze the results by comparing them to find which is the best algorithm. The
classification algorithms used are AdaBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks, K-nearest neighbors
algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, and RandomForest.The introduction describes the data set used,
the importance of the problem, and an overview of the classification methods used. This report then
presents a previously used algorithm, explaining how it works on the dataset and how it differs from the
method used in this experiment. The report is followed by a description of the different classification
methods and comparing the different methods with multiple data. Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) was the best performing classification algorithm on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
